	Bid functionality:
	1. display users with "it" person in second position.
	2. create a function that indexes who is "it" after each turn.
	3. create a "i've bid button" which increments the "it" index by one.
	- The array of users indicates the order of play. Second person goes first. After each round, order advances to next user.
	- The second player listed is "it" and has the ability to create the first bid. Only this player can place a bid. Other uses can see current bid.
	- The div at position number 2 is highlighted with a different color and a carrot on the left. Also, the bid controls appear to the right.
		OR, bid controls and current bid appear at the top.
	- The bid controls display the current bid with controls (TBD) for the player to increase the number of dice or the dice value or both.
	- When a player ends the round by clicking the Liar! button, the dice are revealed and the bid engine determines the winner (pop up notification?)
		One dice is automatically removed from the losing player.
