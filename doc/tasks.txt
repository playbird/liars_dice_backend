	Bid functionality:
	- People who hit the URL get a user ID and a name, but no dice and are "observers" (assigned as "explayers") They looke the same as players who are out of the game.
	- When users click the new button "Join Game" they are assigned dice and made active. This can only occur when a game is not in progress.
